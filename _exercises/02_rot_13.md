Rot13 is an ancient cryptography procedure. It encrypts a message by shifting each character 13 letters in alphabetical order (modulo z).

Write a program that takes a printable character and prints its Rot13 encrypted version. Assume that the input is always a small character.

Experts: Get it working with keeping the character case (a -> n, B -> O). Keep it simple. Do not use stuff that has not been introduced yet.
